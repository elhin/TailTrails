A mock up program for Ivytech Community College's SDEV220 class (fall 2025)

The purpose of this Python and Django based program is to run a website for uploading profiles of lost or found pets.

The webcite includes a welcome page, a home page to display all pet profiles, a lost page to display lost pet profiles only,
a found page for found pet profiles only, a login page, a register page, and a create post page.

Create post is not an option until logged in which causes the login button to be replaced by the create post button
and the register button being replaced with a logout button.

To create a pet profile, after logging in and pressing the create post button, it will ask for the pets status
(either a pet you lost or someone elses pet you found), pets name, pets type (dog, cat, bird, or other),
breed, color, size, last seen location, last seen date, the users contact phone and email, a description, and a photo.
